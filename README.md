# reRun

An app providing advanced filtering of your Strava activities. Great for finding those lovely routes you have run before.

## Developing

Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

Run `npm run serve` (or `ng serve`) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run build` (or `ng build`) to create a production build of the app. The artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

Run `npm run publish` to create a production build and publish your local version. Navigate to `https://marcosteybe.github.io/reRun/`.
