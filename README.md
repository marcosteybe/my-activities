# my-activities

An app providing advanced filtering of your Strava activities. Great for finding those lovely routes you have run before.

## Develop

Run `npm run serve` (or `ng serve`) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` (or `ng build`) to create a production build of the app. The artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publish

Run `npm run publish` to build and publish your local version to `https://marcosteybe.github.io/my-activities/`.
